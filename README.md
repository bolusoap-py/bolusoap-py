I’m Boluwatife Akintayo (supernova), a Python programmer with a growing passion for Machine Learning,data science and artificial intelligence. I speak Python and I’m currently learning the foundations of AI, machine learning, and data science at a beginner level. Alongside coding, I’m also a KDP publisher, A YouTuber to be and a versatile learner, always curious to explore new skills and ideas.

In the coming years, my goal is to grow into a Machine Learning engineer/Data Scientist with strong expertise in machine learning, applying data-driven solutions to real-world problems. I believe in continuous learning, building meaningful connections, and creating projects that make an impact.

Let’s connect, learn, and build together. 🔥🕊️❤️
